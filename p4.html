"Programming language advantages"
The programming languages are the formal constructed languages that designed to communicate the instructions to the machine, particularly the computer, and they can be used to create the programs to control the behavior of the machine or to express algorithms.

The programming Language is very productive to the program, It is very amazing to program if you understand it, You can get the money especially if you can build the website or in making a good application, It is very easy to program once you know the syntax of the programming language, and you will get new showcases in your work.
The programming codes are the instructions that are used to tell the computer what to do, Most programming languages are fairly easy to learn and use, You can make superb websites, All the websites and the applications started with a little code and then progressed over the time, and they can make you rich.

"Programming language disadvantages"
The bugs can get annoying and they are hard to solve sometimes, If you are not good at math then it will not easy to program, Lots of thinking involved, If you don’t have a good memory, then it will be hard to memorize the syntax of the programming language.

If you type the programming slowly, You will take much time to program something, You can type lots of code in seconds since you know the syntax, but it requires thinking and logic, Some programming languages are hard to learn.

C Language does not have concept of OOPs, that’s why C++ is developed, There is no run time checking in C language, There is no strict type checking, You can pass an integer value, It is used for the floating data type, It doesn’t have the concept of namespace, It doesn’t have the concept of constructor or destructor.

Object-Oriented Languages must be well managed, The Instance (or shared class) variables of an object can be accessed by the class-specialized functions, They are not as effective on the simple programs.

The procedural Languages are hard to apply code from one program to another, Modifying one part of the code requires modification of the entire code, As the code grows, It gets harder to understand and modify, The functional Languages can’t do IO, They can not interact with the outside world , And no guarantee first line of code will be executed before second.
